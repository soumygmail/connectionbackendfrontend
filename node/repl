// wrapper in node.js

node.js will wrap it with a function wrapper that looks like the following

(function(exports,require,module,__filenME,__dirname{
    // module code actully lives in here
});

by doing this, node js acheive a few things:
it keeps top-level variable scoped to the module rather than the global Object.apply.

exports 

module.exports 

require

dirname
